PHASE 5: Module Creation Agent tests.

Validates:
- Agent accepts all input types (text, retrieved chunks, web results, PDF)
- Respects duration constraint
- Respects depth requirement
- Objectives use measurable Bloom verbs
- Module count scales appropriately
- Learning mode affects structure
- Output conforms to CourseOutlineSchema
